  ## Description
  
  * This application is an Workplace Employee Tracker utilizing `Mysql` database. The app also relies on `node.js` to install and use required dependencies and also `inquire.js` in order to access the application interface through the command line. Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. This application is a good example of how we can build a visually pleasing interface for managing a company's employee database.
